Build a chat app called Chit Chat using gRPC for communication.
One service (server) and multiple clients (≥3) run as separate processes.

Clients can send chat messages (UTF-8, ≤128 chars) to the service through gRPC.

The service must broadcast every message (with content + logical timestamp) to all active clients.

When someone joins, broadcast:
"Participant X joined Chit Chat at logical time L"
to all clients (including the new one).

When someone leaves, broadcast:
"Participant X left Chit Chat at logical time L"
to all remaining clients.

Each client must:

Display the received message + timestamp.

Log it (store locally).



Checklist:

Design the gRPC API
Define .proto file(s) with message types (e.g., ChatMessage, JoinRequest, LeaveNotice) and service methods (e.g., SendMessage(), Join(), Leave(), ReceiveStream()).
Implement the Server (Chit Chat Service)
Handle joins/leaves.
Broadcast messages (with logical timestamps).
Keep track of active clients.
Implement the Clients
Connect to the server.
Send messages.
Receive broadcasts (streaming).
Display + log messages with timestamps.
Add Logical Clocks
Use Lamport timestamps (or similar) to assign logical times to events (send, join, leave).
Test It
Run one server and at least three clients concurrently.
Verify that messages, joins, and leaves are broadcast correctly and in timestamp order.
